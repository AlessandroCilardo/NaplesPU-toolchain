To build the compiler ensure you have the necesary prerequisites:
	GCC
	cmake
	make
	flex
	bison
	zlib (libzdev)

To build the compiler you must extract the folder NaplesPULLVM in the home directory and then run the script 'setup.sh'.

	./setup.sh -n

You can use the -t parameter to set the number of threads used to build the compiler (default value 4). If for example you want to compile with 2 threads:

	./setup.sh -n -t=2

It is reccomanded to recompile the nu+ libraries before compiling a new kernel. To do so, you must execute in NaplesPULLVM root:

	./setup.sh -l

To compile with the toolchain, you can use the examples contained in the 'kernel' folder. Basically you must create a new Makefile in the project folder as the ones already provided.

For example to generate the memory image of 'helloworld.cpp', you must first compile it using:

	make

The file named 'helloworld_mem.hex' will be genereated in the same directory as the input file.
